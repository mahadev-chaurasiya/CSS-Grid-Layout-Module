            Elephants are the largest existing land animals. They are the only
            surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order
            Proboscidea. Three living species are recognised: the African bush
            elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant (all
            pictured). Distinctive features of elephants include a long,
            flexible proboscis (trunk), long tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like
            legs, and grey skin. They are herbivorous, and stay near water when
            it is accessible. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups,
            which can consist of one female with her calves or several related
            females with offspring. After reaching adulthood, males (bulls) live
            separately, either alone or with other males. Elephants communicate
            by touch, sight, smell, and sound. Threats to their populations
            include poaching for their ivory tusks, habitat destruction, and
            conflicts with local people. Elephants are iconic in human culture
            and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and
            popular culture.
